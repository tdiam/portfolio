### Technical overview

* Written in :md-tag{tag="Java"} SE 11.
* Built with the :md-tag{tag="JavaFX"} framework to develop the desktop application.
* :md-tag{tag="FXML"} and :md-tag{tag="CSS"} were used for crafting the UI.
* :md-tag{tag="Gradle"} was employed as the build system.

Also, JavaFX properties and **observables** were extensively used to achieve reactivity,
as well as Java **resource bundles** for internationalization and better maintenance.
