My involvement as a member of the IT Team of TEDxNTUA included:
* Mainly frontend development for custom theming, AJAX navigation and
animations.
* Some backend development with Twig configuration and templating.
* Undertaking sysadmin and deployment responsibilities.

### Technical overview

#### Backend
* Built on :md-tag{tag="PHP"} and :md-tag{tag="Laravel"}.
* :md-tag{tag="MySQL"} served as the database.
* :md-tag{tag="Twig"} was used as the templating language.

Also, [laravel-localization](https://github.com/mcamara/laravel-localization)
was used for internationalization.

#### Frontend
* Custom theming with vanilla :md-tag{tag="CSS"} (with :md-tag{tag="SCSS"} syntax).
* Usage of :md-tag{tag="Bootstrap"} utilities for the grid system.
* :md-tag{tag="jQuery"} was employed as a DOM manipulation library.
* :md-tag{tag="Pjax"} offered a snappy browsing experience by loading pages via
AJAX.
* :md-tag{tag="Webpack"} served as the build tool.

#### Infrastructure
* :md-tag{tag="Apache"} was used as the web server.
